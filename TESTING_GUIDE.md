# Dynamic Cart - Testing Guide

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

Your navbar cart is now fully dynamic and will update automatically when products are added or removed.

## ✅ What's Working Now

### Before (Static)
```
Cart Icon: (2)  ← Always showed "2" regardless of actual cart
Cart Items: Hardcoded dummy products
```

### After (Dynamic)
```
Cart Icon: (3)  ← Shows actual number of items in cart
Cart Items: Real products from your database with:
  - Product images
  - Product names (clickable to product page)
  - Quantity × Price
  - Remove button (X)
  - Total price
```
